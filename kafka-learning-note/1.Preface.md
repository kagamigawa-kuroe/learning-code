Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system. It's usually been used in microservice architecture.

We could imagine there are some pipes between who sends messages ( like databases ) and who receives messages ( like users ). In those pipes we pass messages and users pick up their messages one by one.

**Some terminologies:**

- producer : The sender of the message

- consumer : The user and receiver of the message are the Consumer

- broker : In Kafka cluster , there may be several servers who will provide service, each server is called a broker.
- topic : Each broker has several topics, we stock different types of messages in different topics. 
- partition : The messages are been stored in files on the Kafka server. So for the same topic messages, we may store them in different files, the partition is the file where the message is stored.
- Offset : The location of message in partition ( file ).
