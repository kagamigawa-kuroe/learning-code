# nginx_learning

When we talk about nginx, we always think something really superlative for examples `reverse proxy`, `load balancer`,which seems quietly difficult to understands, and we always forget that nginx is just a webrunner,that means you can learn it as a server like apache or tomcat at the beginning. That is why I don't dare to use it even thought I have knew it for a long time.

Recently, when I try to deploy my blog in the cloud server, I want to access it with url and without a port, but the blog provide us with some no 80 port, so one way I find is to use nginx to be a proxy.

So take this opportunity, I think it's time to learn more about nginx.
